# üó≥Ô∏è Machine Learning Analysis of Voting Tendencies by Electoral District  
**Income-Based Voter Behavior in Washington State**

**Author:** Yeonbi Han  

## üìÅ Abstract  
This project investigates voter behavior using income data from Washington State, employing machine learning to predict voting patterns. The model integrates geographical and income data, improving voter prediction models using batch processing. Collaborating with team members focusing on gender, education, and age-based studies in other states, this project aims to inform policymakers by providing insights into complex electoral dynamics.

## üß™ Methodology Overview

###  Data Collection and Integration
- Geospatial (GIS) and income data from the U.S. Census and WA voting records are integrated using centroid mapping to match census tracts with precincts, allowing for enhanced analysis of voting patterns.

###  Model Development and Testing
1. **Linear Regression & Polynomial Regression**: Simple models as a baseline.
2. **Random Forest**: Best performance, capturing nonlinear relationships in voting patterns.
3. **SVR (Support Vector Regression)**: Moderate performance, capturing nonlinearity.
4. **Improved Deep Learning (DeepNN)**: Incorporates advanced layers to prevent overfitting and capture intricate patterns in data.

###  Evaluation Metrics
- Metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ are used to compare model performances, while cross-validation ensures generalization across different data subsets.

##  Results
- The **Random Forest model** provided the best accuracy with the lowest RMSE of **0.0797**, followed by SVR and Polynomial Regression. The study demonstrates that integrating income and geospatial data through machine learning leads to effective voting behavior predictions.

##  Challenges
- **GIS Integration**: Aligning different datasets from NY and WA required significant GIS manipulation.
- **Overfitting**: Initial deep learning models with many layers suffered from overfitting, prompting model simplification.
- **Income Binning**: Grouping income data into larger intervals improved interpretability without compromising on the granularity.

## üèÅ Conclusion
The **Random Forest model** was most effective in predicting voter behaviors based on income. This framework can be extended by incorporating more demographic variables (e.g., education, age) and applying it to other states to yield broader insights into electoral patterns.
